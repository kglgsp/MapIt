 ### Part 3 - Extension
 1. Collaborate Details: Katherine Legaspi 

 We chose the Twitter geolocation extension that allows for search and display results on a map. The extension takes in user location, if browser allows, and center maps to the current location. 
 
 Each tweet relevant to the query entered by the user will be marked with a red point. When the marker is clicked, a bubble should display the username, tweet text, and the score.

 A limitation I encountered is that if multiple tweets have the same geolocation (same longitude and latitude), only one tweet is displayed.

Tools: Google Maps API
