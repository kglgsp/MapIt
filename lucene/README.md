## Lucene Indexing
This is not required to run elastic search but I coded it before realizing that so it's included anyways. The json-simple library is required for Java to handle json. Also Lucene 7.7 or newer is required. Once you have both of these added to the project then you can just run the program.

The file that the project reads to index and the path where the index will be built are both defined in LuceneIndexWriter.java
